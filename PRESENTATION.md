**A note taking extension for Mozilla Firefox**
</div>

## Introduction

Quick Notes is an extension designed for [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). With Quick Notes, you can open a sidebar, take notes with Markdown and LaTeX support, and save and load them whenever you want!

## Markdown \& LaTeX support 
![render](figs/render.jpg)
Quick Notes supports most of the Markdown and LaTeX syntax. These functions are powered by open source JS packages [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)(Markdown rendering) and [MaxJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax)(LaTeX rendering).

## Seamless Switch Between Modes
![switch_mode](figs/switch_mode.gif)
Quick Notes provides source mode and preview mode. You can toggle to switch between the two modes seamlessly (just as you can on github).

## Free Resize of Window

## Save \& Load Notes
![save_load](figs/save_load.gif)
You can save \& load your notes on Quick Notes whenever you want! Due to file system write access restriction on JS scripts, this is powered by `browser.downloads` API provided by firefox.

## Friendly UI
