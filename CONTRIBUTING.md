## **Open Issues & Feature Requests**

### üêû **Bugs to Fix**
- **LaTeX Rendering Bug:** Inline math enclosed in `'$'` fails to render properly, while `"$$"` and `"\("` formats work correctly. This might be due to conflicts between **Marked** and **MathJax**. Contributions are welcome to investigate and resolve this issue by adjusting the rendering configuration.

### üé® **Feature Enhancements**
- **Improved Visual Design:** Our current UI is minimal, and we'd love to enhance it with a more polished look, possibly incorporating **NYU-themed** elements. If you have experience in web design, your expertise would be highly appreciated!

We look forward to your contributions and thank you for helping improve Quick Notes! üöÄ
