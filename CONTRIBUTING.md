## Existing Bugs \& Features we want to add
- [ ] **LaTeX rendering bug:** In the LaTeX rendering mode, somehow Quick Note fails to render inline math when the source code is enclosed by '\$'. The LaTeX code renders correctly, however, when its enclosed by "\$\$" or "\\(". Some documents point out this may be due to render conflicts between Markdown and LaTeX. You may try to fix the bug by reconfiguring Marked and MathJaX.
- [ ] **Better visual design:** At this point our visual design is quite simple. We are planning to upgrade it and incorporate some NYU elements! If you are an expert in web design, feel free to contribute to this project!
